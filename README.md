# arabic_made_easy

My final year project at University which scored an outstanding 74% "A" grade. 
A modern Flutter mobile application which can be used to learn the Arabic language in a fun, gamified, and effective way.
After thorough research on the current best ways to learn a new language a few different methods were found, this app uses all those methods in a gamified approach to keep users engaged.
